# Analysis

The analysis is performed bya single script file run_analysis.R which does the following:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and writes it to the DSV file "averages.txt"

For more details on how above are achieved please look at the comments inside the script
